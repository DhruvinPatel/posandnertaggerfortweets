TASK: TO FIND POS & NER TAGS FOR TWEETS

For more information about problem (see this link): http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~parags/teaching/col776/assignments/ass3/ass3-b.pdf

The directory contains MODEL_ner and MODEL_pos which were trained on dataset given in above link. Also using few more datasets (as described in Writeup).

HOW TO RUN 

You need to define $MALLET_INC (which is the path of built MALLET directory, see the comments in run.sh file)

./compile.sh
./run.sh pos_input pos_output ner_input ner_output 

This will generate two files pos_output ner_output which contains POS and NER Tags corresponding to each token.

To evaluate the model one can compute Macro F-measure using Fscore_MODEL.py. (Provided you have the respective Gold file ) 
Following are the commands to use the script:
python Fscore_MODEL.py MODEL_output.txt MODEL_gold.txt
